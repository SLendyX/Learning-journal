                        <h1 class="aboutme-title">Hi there! My name is Radu and welcome
                            to my learning journal.
                        </h1>
                        <p>After several failed attempts to learn frontend development I finnaly
                            found the perfect platform to teach me what I need
                            to make the perfect site that I desire.
                        </p>
                        <span><strong>How I stay commited to learning</strong></span>
                        <p>
                            I do have and have had a peculiar interest to learning new
                            things especially those based around computer science
                            and programming languages. Even though I do have this burning
                            desire to learn more it's not strong enough to make me learn
                            consistently throughout the day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As such I have created this journal so I can keep track of my journey,
                            and in this way I keep accountable for the dayly working load.
                        </p>
                        <span><strong>How I got started</strong></span>
                        <p>
                            I started off gradually, filling up each article with the notes that
                            I took throughout the courses and tried as best as I could to explain those 
                            concepts in my own words in order to fully grasp the main idea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though this site started off as a personal project, it got a lot
                            of attention from other people interested in frontend development and
                            I am happy that I could help too.
                        </p>
