                </h1>
                <p>After several failed attempts to learn frontend development I finnaly
                    found the perfect platform to teach me what I need
                    to make the perfect site that I desire.
                </p>
                <img src="/images/title-image4.png">
                <span><strong>How I stay commited to learning</strong></span>
                <p>
                    I do have and have had a peculiar interest to learning new
                    things especially those based around computer science
                    and programming languages. Even though I do have this burning
                    desire to learn more it's not strong enough to make me learn
                    consistently throughout the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such I have created this journal so I can keep track of my journey,
                    and in this way I keep accountable for the dayly working load.
                </p>
                <span><strong>How I got started</strong></span>
                <p>
                    I started off gradually, filling up each article with the notes that
                    I took throughout the courses and tried as best as I could to explain those 
                    concepts in my own words in order to fully grasp the main idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though this site started off as a personal project, it got a lot
                    of attention from other people interested in frontend development and
                    I am happy that I could help too.
                </p>
